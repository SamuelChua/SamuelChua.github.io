Hello! My name is **Samuel Chua**, and I am a first-year Robotics Masters student at University of Pennsylvania. I believe in exploring the unknown and very much enjoy the thrill of learning through curiosity! 

My research interests stem from **autonomous robots** to topics such as vision-language models, agile autonomy, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), computer vision, perception and field robotics. 

I am currently an incoming SDE intern at Amazon, and will be working in the BOS17 office with the Amazon Foundational People Data Services (FPDS) team!

I received my B.S. in Computer Science & Engineering from UCLA in 2025. I worked with Professor Brett Lopez in VECTR lab on SLAM and change detection.
